Subject: [PATCH 5/82] Fixed empty package: CPACK_SET_DESTDIR has to be set to
 ON.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The 'empty package' issue has been discussed here: http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2010-February/035171.html:

"""
By default CPack does not use the DESTDIR option during the installation
phase.  Instead it sets the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the full path of the
temporary directory being used by CPack to stage the install package. This
can be changed by setting CPACK_SET_DESTDIR to on. If the DESTDIR option is
on, CPack will use the projects cache value for CPACK_INSTALL_PREFIX, and
set DESTDIR to the temporary staging area. This allows absolute paths to be
installed under the temporary directory. Relative paths are installed into
DESTDIR/${project's CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} where DESTDIR is set to the
temporary staging area.

I think you want CPACK_SET_DESTDIR, then make sure CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is
how you want it before you run cpack.
